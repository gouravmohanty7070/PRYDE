cloud making a 360° coverage from the technological end. Data
will be collected by legitimate and trusted sources, AI will be
used to power the chatbot which is the core of Pryde and cloud
will be used to make the application more powerful and have
extra capabilities.  
</li></br>
<li>Pryde is a solution which adds multi-dimensional value which
caters to the society (LGBTQ+ community by offering them access
to inclusive sexual healthcare), people (doctors and medical
professionals to be aware that there is a need of treating
people based on their gender and their sexual history),
sustainability (Pryde aims at creating a society where every
individuality is celebrated) and business. 
</li></br>
<li>Pryde is an attempt to make a genuine change in the society, to
cater to an underrepresented section of the society and ensure
that they're living their lives in a happy and beautiful manner.
There have been attempts to cater to the mental health of LGBTQ+
community which Team Blueberry Muffins acknowledges and hopes
they would only succeed in the near future, however, for sexual
health - Pryde will be the first of its kind.
